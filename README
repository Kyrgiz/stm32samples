These are my simple snippets for STM32 (compiled with libopencm3)

- client-term is terminal client used instead of "com"

- simple_cdc is simplest USB-CDC working in char-mode, press H for help (another commands are for LEDs switching and test of integer input)

- 1_wire - pseudo-hardware realisation of 1-wire protocol
